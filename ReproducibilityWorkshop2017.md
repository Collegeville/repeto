#### Background
Reproducibility is at the heart of the scientific method.  In order to distinguish approaches and degrees of reproducibility, research communities use synonyms such as replicate and repeat to convey specific kinds of reproducibility.  In these efforts, incompatible definitions can and have emerged.  While differences are not desirable, with proper context we can communicate within and across communities, if competing definitions are clearly described.

It is well known that there are at least two competing taxonomies that have significant communities and significant overlap within computing and computational sciences.  The situation leads to confusion among researchers who work across these communities.

This one-day workshop is focused on characterizing reproducibility taxonomies related to computing and computational sciences.  
The workshop is intended to discuss the competing taxonomies and accurately characterize them by illustrating their use with a set of concrete scenarios in a subsequent report.  The purpose is not to create a single taxonomy.
